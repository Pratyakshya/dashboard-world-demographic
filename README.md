# dashboard-world-demographic

This is a dashboard created on World Demographic Indicators Extract. I picked this dataset from : https://www.kaggle.com/mathsian/world-demographic-indicators-extract

This dataset is an extract of 11 development indicators across 217 countries from World Bank. The most recently available data point for each indicator for each country has been taken, to make as much data available as possible. This does mean that not all the data within a row or column is always from the same year.
